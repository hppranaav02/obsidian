- Fault Injection
	- Overclocking to reduce time required for an instruction to run
	- Underpowering the supply voltage substantially to add a time lag for instructions to execute in more than one clock cycle (between 2 rising edges)
	- Can use these/ try these on the chipwhisperer during the lab sessions
	- Optical fault injection using a laser to switch a transistor through ion injection into a semi conductor
	- Electromagnetic fault injection using a disruption in magnetic or electric field to generate a switch in the charge in the transistor
- Fault exploitation

- Fault injection and fault exploitation in RSA using differential fault analysis in the chinese remainder theorem
- Bellcore attack
- Collision fault analysis
  Fault correction 
  - Triple modular redundancy (TPR)
