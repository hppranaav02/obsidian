- Hardware is used in a loop, tightly coupled in a loop
- sensors produce analog signals which is converted in to digital which is then processed as information.
	- Either display
	- or drive actuators and in loop back to the environment. Here the digital signal is converted back to analog
	- sample and hold circuits used to convert from analog to digital for information processing.
		- higher sampling rate == precise measuring
		- Clock based sampler for sampling rate, capacitor holds value
	- Discritization of values (Flash A/D convertor)
		- Reference voltage slope based comparator used to generate the digital bits can be encoded down to as many as needed.
		- Resolution is the precision of the convertor, the end digital product (in bits)
		- Resolution in volts is the minimum physical threshold of the circuit to generate a difference in the output by one bit.
		- parallel hence fast, done in one clock cycle per sample O(1)
		- Requires more hardware, hence more cost, hardware coplexity - O(n)
	- Successive approximation discritization
		- Use approximation register to choose digital value based on a preset values stored in the control logic
		- Values are found through binary search.
		- Comparator is in analog, the approximation value is D/A then compared to the input value
		- More bits means more precise coparison
		- if n bits, takes n clock cycles - O(logN)
		- Hardware is low, single comparator
- Information Processing
	- Can have multiple types of computational cores, chosen based on use case. Choice is due to flexibility v/s performance. 
	- GPP - general purpose
		- high performance, superscalar, super pipeline
		- complex memory units
		- complex circuitry and memory maps cause timing issues due to unpredictability of instruction handling and memory fetches
